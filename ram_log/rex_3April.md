- Make expansion wrapper, similar to the idea of unit wrapper
- Make ownership update in expansion manager
- Add get_all_enemy, and make them support list input
- Make expansion ownership detection
- Reduce logging level
- Improved building placement
- Tried to fix finding expansion but it is hard to locate self/enemy base with 
distance alone. Thinking of hardcoding.
